    Lise Meitner was the scientist who discovered nuclear fission. She was born in Vienna in 1878. She recieved her doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1906, and then attended Max Planck's lectures in Berlin in 1907. She joined Otto Hahn in his research of radioactivity. Because she was Jewish, she left Germany for Sweden in 1938. In 1939, based on Hahn's and Fritz Strassmann's work, she and her nephew, Otto Frisch, discovered nuclear fission. In 1934 Hahn recieved the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for nuclear fission, although she did deserve a share in the reward. Meitner was invited to work on the Manhattan Project during this time, but she refused. She died in Cambridge, England, in 1968, after retiring there eight years earlier. The inscription on her tombstone reads, "A physicist who never lost her humanity".
