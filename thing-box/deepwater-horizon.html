<h4>Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010: path of the oil</h4>
Map depicting the effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, caused by the explosion of an oil rig off the coast of Louisiana on April 20, 2010. Scientists noted that the prevailing paths of the Gulf of Mexico's Loop Current and a detached eddy located to the west kept much of the oil, which covered a sizable part of the gulf some three months after the accident, from reaching shore.
